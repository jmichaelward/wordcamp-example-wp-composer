# Example WP-Composer Install
## About
This project was developed as part of a presentation, _Modernizing
Your Development Workflow Using Composer_, to introduce WordPress
developers to the PHP dependency manager, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

## Requirements/Considerations
This package assumes you are running [Laravel Valet](https://github.com/laravel/valet/)
 on macOS, and that you're cloning the repository into Valet's parked
 directory. It _may_ work in other environments, but I make no guarantees,
 as I developed this on my own machine for demonstration purposes. :)
 Your results may vary.

Assuming you have already installed Composer, and you're running Laravel
Valet and MySQL, you should be good to go!

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jmichaelward/wordcamp-example-wp-composer.git`
2. Change into its directory `cd wordcamp-example-wp-composer`
3. Run `composer install`
4. Answer the questions triggered by the installation wizard.
5. Log in to your newly installed site in the browser!
